# World_Weather_Analysis
## General Overview
This project involved utilizing APIs from Google & Openweathermap to create an interactive application where a customer can input their desired max/min temperatures for a trip & will be provided with a map of options that meet their criteria. Further, a second map can be created that the customer can plan an itinerary with cities that all match their weather preferences.
